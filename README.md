## Application behavior

Front end is developed using React JS. On the landing page you will have a background div which covers the 100% height of the viewport and a box inside it which moves horizontally based on the vertical user scroll. Below this sections , a group of button (non clickable ) is present whose opacity will be 0 when user scrolls to its position and then when user scroll down to the bottom of the page it increases upto 1. A number variable is also initially shown as 0 when user just starts to scroll and when end of the page is reached then the value changes. Responsiveness of the page is achieved using flexbox.  



Due to time constrain , I haven't implemented this as a production ready code. So kindly do excuse.
